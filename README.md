### 1. Introduction 

#### Problem Statement
Despite ongoing efforts to increase animal adoption rates in shelters, many animals remain unadopted for long periods. This issue not only affects the well-being of the shelter animals but also strains shelter resources and impacts community perceptions of animal welfare. Various factors, including the breed, age, color, and health status of the animals, as well as the practices and conditions within the shelters, play a crucial role in determining adoption outcomes.

The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of adoption for animals using classification models and identifying specific characteristics that correlate with lower/high adoption likelihood. When certrain animal falls into the "not adopted" category, it is essential to develop alternative strategies to prevent euthanasia for these at-risk animals and implementing targeted interventionsâ€”such as specialized marketing, behavioral training, foster programs, or partnerships with other rescue organizations.

By understanding the predictors of adoption, shelters can adjust their operational strategies. This will not only improve adoption rates but also ensure that animals receive the care and support to find new homes or alternative solutions, thereby minimizing the incidence of euthanasia and promoting a more humane approach to animal welfare.

#### Outcome Definition
Outcome types "adoption" and "return to owner" are classified as the positive outcomes, while other outcome types are classified as the negative outcomes.

The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights for shelters. By pinpointing the most influential features affecting adoption rates, shelters can prioritize their resources and efforts in areas that will yield the highest impact, leading to improved outcomes for animals. Using the classification model to establish a system to predict the intake animals likelihood of adoption, this will help shelters to make necessary adjustments for these animals and to continuously improve adoption rates.
